# comunica-ifsp

ComunicaIFSP is a final college project.
It is a internal communication system of the institution between teachers and students.

The idea of the project arose of the difficulty that the educational institution has in obtaining means of communication with students quickly and efficiently.
Considering that e-mail and student platforms do not reach all the required students if the message needs to be instantaneous.

This project is being developed for the Android platform.
